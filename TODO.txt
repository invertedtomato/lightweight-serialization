 - Consider how to beat MsgPack! https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md
    => Collapse low values into length field
    => MIAAAAAA [AAAAAA [AAAAAA ...]] [BBBBBBBB [BBBBBBBB ...]]]
       M - Another A byte follows
       I - Is A the numeric value, otherwise it is the length of B following
       A - Numeric value either representing the B length, or is the value itself (Null, Bool, Int)
       B - Bytes (String, Map, Array, Float, DateTime, TimeSpan)
    NO - Use field type instead
 - Throw SchemaMismatchException() instead of ProtocolViolation
 
 - Test for things that shouldn't be serializable?
 - Add options on field attribute
 - Add datetime support
 - Add timespan support
 - Add float support
 - Add null-able support
