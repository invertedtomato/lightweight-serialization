 - Consider how to beat MsgPack! https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md
    => Collapse low values into length field based on field data type
 - Throw SchemaMismatchException() instead of ProtocolViolation
 - Only use POCO coder for classes decorated with a LightWeight attribute so that it doesn't accentially get used on other things with nil result
 
 - support class fields as well as properties
 - Test for things that shouldn't be serializable?
 - Add options on field attribute
 - Add datetime support
 - Add timespan support
 - Add float support
 - Add null-able support
